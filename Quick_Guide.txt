The following is a quick guide to using our programs (which will be updated as the programs change).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TELEOP:

Joystick 1:

Left Analog Stick Up/Down: Drive forwards and backwards
Left Analog Stick Right/Left: Rotate in place
Right Bumper: Turn the sweeper forwards (to collect debris)
Right Trigger: Turn the sweeper backwards (to unjam the sweeper, when neccessary)
Top Hat Up/Down: Rotate debris tube up/down
Top Hat Right/Left: Swivel arm (including debris tube) left/right
B Button: Open door on debris tube, the door will stay open while the button is held down, and then revert to being closed.
A Button: Lower hooks using measuring tape
Y Button: Raise hooks using measuring tape
Left Trigger: Rotate hook lifting apparatus upwards
Left Bumper: Rotate hook lifting apparatus downwards
Right Analog Stick Up/Down: Pull with robot lifting motors up/down

Joystick 2:

A Button: Move arm to collection position
X Button: Move arm to dispensing position for BLUE
B Button: Move arm to dispensing position for RED
Top Hat Right/Left: Raise/Lower hooks using measuring tape
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTONOMOUS (not functional yet):

There are several options to configure. The configuration of these options should show in telemetry.
Press and release the left touch sensor to decrement the selected setting, and the right touch sensor to increment the selected setting.
To move on to the next setting, press both touch sensors and release them.

Current Settings: Color, Wait time, and Smart Detection

Default Settings (respectively): RED, 0, false

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DRIVE_CONTROL:

Upon initialization, the telemetry display should cycle every few seconds (that time can be adjusted) through
forwards, backwards, left, and right. Run the program when the desired option is onscreen to start moving 
or rotating in that direction. Stop the program to stop moving or rotating. A few runs of this program should allow
for convenient robot return in autonomous testing and potentially other situations.
