The following is a quick guide to using our programs (which will be updated as the programs change).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TELEOP:



Joystick 1:

Left Analog Stick Up/Down: Drive forwards and backwards
Left Analog Stick Right/Left: Rotate in place
Right Analog Stick Button: Reverse drive direction
Right Analog Stick Up/Down: Drive forwards and backwards slowly, at a fixed power.
Right Bumper: Turn the sweeper forwards (to collect debris)
Right Trigger: Turn the sweeper backwards (to unjam the sweeper, when neccessary)
Left Bumper: Raise wall
Left Trigger: Lower wall
Y Button: Extend linear slides
A Button Retract linear slides
Top Hat Left/Right: Swivel linear slides
Top Hat Up/Down: Raise/Lower dumper


Joystick 2:

Left Bumper: Raise wall
Left Trigger: Lower wall
Right Bumper: Extends linear slides
Right Trigger: Retract linear slides
Right Analog Stick Button: Move swivel to collection position
A Button: Move swivel to red medium goal position
B Button: Move swivel to blue medium goal position
X Button: Move swivel to red high goal position
Y Button: Move swivel to blue high goal position

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTONOMOUS:

There are several options to configure. The configuration of these options should show in telemetry.
Press and release the left touch sensor to decrement the selected setting, and the right touch sensor to increment the selected setting.
To move on to the next setting, press both touch sensors and release them. This process can also be done with the left and right bumpers on gamepad 1
instead of the left and right touch sensors.

Current Settings: Color, Wait time, and Robot Path

Default Settings (respectively): BLUE, 0, LOW_GOAL_AND_COLLECT_ON_SAME_SIDE

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DRIVE_CONTROL:

Upon initialization, the telemetry display should cycle every few seconds (that time can be adjusted) through
forwards, backwards, left, and right. Run the program when the desired option is onscreen to start moving 
or rotating in that direction. Stop the program to stop moving or rotating. A few runs of this program should allow
for convenient robot return in autonomous testing and potentially other situations.
