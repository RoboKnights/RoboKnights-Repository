AUTONOMOUS:

There are several options to configure. The configuration of these options should show in telemetry.
Press and release the left touch sensor to decrement the selected setting, and the right touch sensor to increment the selected setting.
To move on to the next setting, press both touch sensors and release them.

Current Settings: Color, Wait time, and Smart Detection

Default Settings (respectively): RED, 0, false

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DRIVE_CONTROL:

Upon initialization, the telemetry display should cycle every few seconds (that time can be adjusted) through
forwards, backwards, left, and right. Run the program when the desired option is onscreen to start moving 
or rotating in that direction. Stop the program to stop moving or rotating. A few runs of this program should allow
for convenient robot return in autonomous testing and potentially other situations.
