The following is a quick guide to using our programs (which will be updated as the programs change).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TELEOP:



Joystick 1:

Left Analog Stick Up/Down: Drive forwards and backwards
Left Analog Stick Right/Left: Rotate in place
Right Analog Stick Button: Reverse drive direction
Right Analog Stick: Polar control of swivel - 90 degrees of analog stick angle corresponds to 45 degrees of swivel.
Right Bumper: Turn the sweeper forwards (to collect debris) if polar swivel control is not being used. Extend linear lides otherwise.
Right Trigger: Turn the sweeper backwards (to unjam the sweeper, when neccessary), if polar control is not being used. Retract linear slides otherwise.
Left Bumper: Lower wall
Left Trigger: Raise wall
Y Button: Extend linear slides
A Button: Retract linear slides
B Button: Turn on reset automation, which sets swivel, dumper, and linear slides back to initial position. To end the automation, press B again, or operate sweeper.
Top Hat Left/Right: Swivel linear slides incrementally (slow and laggy)
Top Hat Up/Down: Raise/Lower dumper


Joystick 2:

Left Bumper: Raise left climber triggerer
Left Trigger: Lower left climber triggerer
Right Bumper: Raise right climber triggerer
Right Trigger: Lower right climber triggerer
Right Analog Stick Up/Down: Extend/Retract linear slides
Right Analog Stick Button: Move swivel to collection position
Left Analog Stick Up/Down: Move robot lift motors (always at full power)
B Button: Turn on reset automation, which sets swivel, dumper, and linear slides back to initial position. To end the automation, press B again, or operate sweeper.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTONOMOUS:

There are several options to configure. The configuration of these options should show in telemetry.
Press and release the left touch sensor to decrement the selected setting, and the right touch sensor to increment the selected setting.
To move on to the next setting, press both touch sensors and release them. This process can also be done with the left and right bumpers on gamepad 1
instead of the left and right touch sensors. UPDATE: as of now, only the gamepad can be useda, and not the touch sensors.

Current Options (option name before colon; choices listed after colon, with default option listed first):

Color: RED, BLUE
Start Wait Time: 0-30 seconds (0 is default)
Starting Position: RAMP START, CORNER START, STRAIGHT START
Path: PARK, COLLECTION, RAMP, DEFENSE
Beacon Scoring: ON, OFF
Sweeper On: ON, OFF

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DRIVE_CONTROL:

Upon initialization, the telemetry display should cycle every few seconds (that time can be adjusted) through
forwards, backwards, left, and right. Run the program when the desired option is onscreen to start moving 
or rotating in that direction. Stop the program to stop moving or rotating. A few runs of this program should allow
for convenient robot return in autonomous testing and potentially other situations.
